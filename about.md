Hi there! My name is Amanda. I'm currently a senior studying computer science at New York University. In the past, I've worked with data visualization, cloud infrastructure, and security. I love to code and am always eager to learn more about new trends in tech!

### More Information

Spent half my life in New Orleans and the other half in New York City. When I'm not coding, you may find me drawing, aimlessly roaming NYC with my film camera, or drinking bubble tea with friends :-)
